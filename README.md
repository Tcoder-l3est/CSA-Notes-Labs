## Lab 1 Familiarized with WinDLX

Through this experiment, you will be familiar with the operation and use of the WinDLX simulator, and understand the structure and characteristics of the DLX instruction set.

## Lab 2 Calculating the GCM

Through this experiment, master the operation and use of the WinDLX simulator, know the flow of the WinDLX five-stage pipeline when executing specific programs, and be familiar with the DLX instruction set structure and its characteristics.

## Lab 3 Calculating Prime Numbers

Through experiments, master the operation method of WINDLX, pay special attention to the number of beats of the instructions in the pipeline in the single-step execution of the WinDLX program.

## Lab 4 Structural Hazard

Through this experiment, deepen the understanding of structure correlation and understand the impact of structure correlation on CPU performance.
